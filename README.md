First HW to see if github classroom is working.

   * This is a variation on Project Euler problem 1.
   * The input will be a single int n (but provided as a String in args[0]).
   * The output should be the solution to this problem:
   *
   * If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
   * we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
   * Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below n.
   *
   * Sample solutions
   * Input: 10
   * Output: 23
   *
   * Input: 100
   * Output: 2318
